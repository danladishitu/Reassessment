## ML for an online computer store

### Building a machine learning model to improve the effectiveness of an email advertising campaign.

### Problem statement

- The feasibility of using machine learning to improve the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns.
- Over the year, the company conducts a series of email campaigns to promote their new items, and each email sent has a unique promotion code that allows the company to track if each email sent resulted in a purchase (this is called \conversion").
- They are currently employing the so-called batch-and-blast method (which entails sending all emails to their whole database), but they are concerned that this would result in high unsubscribe rates and reduce the overall efficacy of the campaigns.

### Proposed solution
The model will help in the pursuit of targeted email marketing: for each campaign, emails will be delivered to just those clients who are most likely to purchase the advertised product.


I have used Python and its diverse library to build the machine learning pipeline to tackle this classification problem. To improve readability, the code was written in a Jupyter notebook.

The following are the four machine learning algorithms for classification problems:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine** 
- **Naive Bayes** 
- **Random Forest**
