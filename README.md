##ML for an online computer store

###Building a machine learning model to improve the effectiveness of an email advertising campaign.

The model will help in the pursuit of targeted email marketing: for each campaign, emails will be delivered to just those clients who are most likely to purchase the advertised product.

I have used Python and its diverse library to build the machine learning pipeline to tackle this classification problem. To improve readability, the code was written in a Jupyter notebook.

The following are the four machine learning algorithms for classification problems:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine** 
- **Naive Bayes** 
- **Random Forest**
